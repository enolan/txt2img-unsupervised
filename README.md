This is a project investigating the possibility of building a text to image model without using any
labeled training data, relying only on CLIP and unlabeled images. The best description of the
project is [here](http://www.echonolan.net/posts/2024-03-09-is-it-possible-to-train-a-text-to-image-model-without-any-text.html). As of this point,
there's little reason for anybody but me to run any of this code.
